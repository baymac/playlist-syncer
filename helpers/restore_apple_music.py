"""
Restore Apple Music library from a backup JSON created by backup_apple_music.py.

What it restores:
  - All library tracks (searches Apple Music catalog by artist + title, adds to library)
  - Loved/favourite status
  - Playlist memberships (creates missing playlists, adds tracks)

Note: Tracks are found by searching the local Music catalog. Tracks not available
on Apple Music (region-locked, removed) will be skipped and logged.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/restore_apple_music.py --backup ~/Documents/apple_music_backups/backup_2026-04-26_120000.json
    uv run python scripts/restore_apple_music.py --backup <path> --dry-run
    uv run python scripts/restore_apple_music.py --backup <path> --skip-playlists
