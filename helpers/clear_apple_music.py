"""
Clear Apple Music library — removes all tracks from library and all user playlists.

⚠️  DESTRUCTIVE — this cannot be undone without a backup + restore.
    Always run backup_apple_music.py first.

Requires typing "DELETE MY LIBRARY" at the prompt to proceed.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/clear_apple_music.py
    uv run python scripts/clear_apple_music.py --favourites-only   # only remove loved tracks
    uv run python scripts/clear_apple_music.py --dry-run            # show what would happen
